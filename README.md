This repository includes Jupyter notebooks for harvesting and analysing data from the NSW State Archives.

Run the notebooks in this repository live on MyBinder â€” just click the button (it might take a little while to load).

I've also created [a repository](https://github.com/wragge/srnsw-indexes) containing all the data harvested from the NSW State Archives Online Indexes.
